# **My Third Data Analysis Project 🚀**  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains my third project, where I applied advanced Excel functions to manipulate and analyze data while reinforcing my version control workflow using Git and GitHub. The goal was to enhance my proficiency in data retrieval, logical functions, and date-based operations while efficiently managing project versions.

## **Assignment Breakdown**  

### **1️⃣ Advanced Data Processing in Excel 📊**  
In this phase, I worked with powerful Excel functions to extract, analyze, and manipulate data efficiently.  

✅ **Downloaded the dataset** – Started with the **“Dataset for Practice”** file.  
✅ **Followed tutorial videos** – Learned advanced formulas and best practices for data handling.  
✅ **Used lookup functions** – Applied **VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH** to find and retrieve specific data points.  
✅ **Implemented logical functions** – Used **IF, AND, OR** statements for conditional data evaluation.  
✅ **Worked with date & time functions** – Manipulated and formatted date-based information for analysis.  
✅ **Saved the processed dataset** – Exported the final refined file as **“Advanced_Excel_IsaacAdeyeye.xlsx”**.

### **2️⃣ Git & GitHub Workflow 🖥️**  
To integrate version control into the project, I followed best practices with Git and GitHub.  

✅ **Initialized a Git repository** – Set up local version control for tracking progress.  
✅ **Committed changes systematically** – Maintained a clear record of modifications.  
✅ **Pushed updates to GitHub** – Uploaded the project files to a remote repository.  
✅ **Cloned, modified, and pushed updates** – Practiced handling project versions effectively.
